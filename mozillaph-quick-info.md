# About the Mozilla Philippines Community

The Mozilla Philippines Community is the official Mozilla-supported community initiative in the Philippines. Initiated by Gen Kanai, Seth Bindernagel, and Regnard Raquedan, the community aims to support Mozilla in its mission to build the Internet as a global public resource, open and accessible to all. We believe this can be achieved by promoting openness, innovation, and opportunity on the Web.

Currently being led by Mozilla Reps in the Philippines, all members are contributing on a volunteer basis all over the country.

BE ONE OF US. Volunteering with Mozilla is open and free. You may choose your commitment level and the time to want to give. Open to anyone, regardless of age and professional/academic background. Click here for more info: http://join.mozillaph.org

## Mission
Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

At Mozilla, weâ€™re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.
